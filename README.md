This repository contains the scripts for the sampling exhaustiveness tests along with the inputs for the benchmark cases and results on the benchmarks.  

The inputs folder contains inputs for sampling for the benchmark cases,such as PDB and crosslink files.

The scripts folder contains scripts for sampling IMP models and scoring ZDOCK models, as well as the scripts for the protocol and plotting outputs from the protocol.

The results folder contains the models sampled by IMP, and the resulting clusters of good-scoring models, along with the top models from ZDOCK and the outputs of the sampling exhaustiveness protocol.
